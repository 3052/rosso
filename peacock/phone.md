If you start the app and Sign In, this request:

~~~
POST https://rango.id.peacocktv.com/signin/service/international HTTP/2.0
content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
x-skyott-device: MOBILE
x-skyott-proposition: NBCUOTT
x-skyott-provider: NBCU
x-skyott-territory: US

userIdentifier=MY_EMAIL&password=MY_PASSWORD
~~~

will fail:

~~~
HTTP/2.0 429
~~~

You can fix this problem by removing this request header before starting the
app:

~~~
set modify_headers '/~u signin.service.international/x-skyott-device/'
~~~

Header needs to be removed from that request only, since other requests need the
header.
